# Add i18n migration endpoint for production database

## Changes
- Added `/admin/migrate-i18n` endpoint to update existing listings with translation fields
- Created `routes/admin.js` with migration logic
- Added migration documentation in `I18N_MIGRATION.md`

## Why
The deployed production site doesn't show listing titles/descriptions in translated languages because the production database has old listings without `title_i18n` and `description_i18n` fields.

## How to Use
After deploying this update, visit:
`https://your-site.onrender.com/admin/migrate-i18n`

This will update all existing listings in the production database with the missing i18n fields.

## Security
Remove or protect the `/admin/migrate-i18n` endpoint after running it once.
