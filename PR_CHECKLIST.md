## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Before Submitting PR - Manual Testing

- [ ] **Online Mode:**
  - [ ] Visit `/listings` and verify page loads correctly
  - [ ] Check browser console for `[OfflineStorage] Saved X listings`
  - [ ] Open DevTools → Application → IndexedDB → Verify "WanderLustDB" has listings

- [ ] **Offline Mode:**
  - [ ] Use DevTools → Network → Set to "Offline"
  - [ ] Refresh or navigate to `/listings`
  - [ ] Verify cached listings are displayed (not just offline message)
  - [ ] Check that listing cards show:
    - [ ] Images (or fallback)
    - [ ] Titles and locations
    - [ ] Prices
    - [ ] Category badges
    - [ ] "OFFLINE" badge
  - [ ] Verify connection status indicator shows "Offline"

- [ ] **Back Online:**
  - [ ] Set network back to "Online"
  - [ ] Verify auto-redirect to live listings within 2 seconds
  - [ ] Check that online banner appears briefly

- [ ] **Service Worker:**
  - [ ] DevTools → Application → Service Workers shows "activated and running"
  - [ ] No console errors related to service worker
  - [ ] Static assets cached correctly

---

## 🔍 Code Quality Checks

- [x] No syntax errors (EJS linter warnings are false positives)
- [x] Console.log statements included for debugging (acceptable for SW)
- [x] Proper error handling in offline-storage.js
- [x] CSS follows existing style patterns
- [x] JavaScript uses async/await properly
- [x] IndexedDB operations are wrapped in try-catch
- [x] Service worker has proper cache versioning

---

## 📝 Known Issues / False Positives

### Linter Warning (Safe to Ignore)
```
Expression expected in index.ejs line 316
```
**Reason:** VS Code linter doesn't recognize EJS syntax `<%- JSON.stringify(allListings) %>`  
**Status:** This is valid EJS syntax and works correctly at runtime

## 📸 Screenshots to Include in PR

Consider adding screenshots of:
1. Listings page online (with console showing saved listings)
2. Offline page displaying cached listings
3. DevTools showing IndexedDB with cached data
4. Connection status banner (offline/online)

## 💬 PR Description Template

```markdown
## Description
Fixed offline access issue where users could not view listings when offline. 
Previously, only a generic "You're Offline" message was shown. Now, all 
previously viewed listings are displayed from IndexedDB cache.

## Changes
- Enhanced `offline.html` to fetch and display cached listings from IndexedDB
- Added automatic listing data caching in `index.ejs`
- Improved service worker offline request handling
- Updated README with offline feature documentation

## How to Test
1. Visit `/listings` while online (listings auto-cache to IndexedDB)
2. Go offline (DevTools → Network → Offline)
3. Refresh page - cached listings should display with images and details
4. Go back online - auto-redirects to live listings
